# First 72 Hours After a Breach: A Legal Checklist

When a cybersecurity breach is discovered, the clock starts ticking—not just from a technical recovery perspective, but legally as well. Regulatory timelines, contractual obligations, and litigation risks make the first 72 hours absolutely critical. This article outlines a highly detailed legal checklist to follow within that window to help mitigate legal exposure, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.

## **Hour 0–1: Detection and Initial Containment**

### 1. **Activate the Incident Response Plan (IRP)**
The IRP should be treated as a legally binding operational guide. Confirm activation by timestamping in the organization's incident log. Roles and responsibilities should be reviewed and each team member notified via a secure, out-of-band (OOB) communication channel such as [Signal](https://signal.org/) or [Wickr](https://www.wickr.com/). Communication platforms must comply with internal IR protocols and log activities for audit trails. If using an IR orchestration platform like [Cortex XSOAR](https://www.paloaltonetworks.com/cortex/cortex-xsoar), all tasks should be automatically tracked and assigned.

### 2. **Preserve Digital Evidence**
Preservation of volatile data must begin immediately. Use [Magnet RAM Capture](https://www.magnetforensics.com/resources/magnet-ram-capture/) for memory collection before powering down systems. Create forensic disk images with [FTK Imager](https://accessdata.com/product-download/ftk-imager-version-4-2) using SHA-256 hashing to validate image integrity. Log all evidence collection actions, including timestamp, operator, and tool versions. Store copies in an encrypted, write-once location with backup redundancy. Ensure logs from [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) or [LogRhythm](https://logrhythm.com/) are exported and signed to preserve admissibility.

## **Hour 1–12: Initial Legal and Regulatory Assessment**

### 3. **Determine Legal Classification of the Incident**
Classify the incident under relevant jurisdictions by analyzing data residency and type. For GDPR, determine whether data access was accidental, unlawful, or malicious, as defined under Article 4. For CCPA, assess whether the breach involved unencrypted personal information in combination with an access vector. Utilize platforms like [TrustArc](https://trustarc.com/) for pre-mapped regulatory classification workflows across jurisdictions.

### 4. **Engage Outside Legal Counsel**
Immediately engage external breach counsel to oversee communication, review findings, and preserve privilege. Confirm that counsel is experienced with sector-specific laws (e.g., HIPAA, FERPA, SOX). Refer to the [NetDiligence Breach Coach List](https://netdiligence.com/breach-coach/) or [IAPP Privacy Bar](https://iapp.org/connect/communities/section-privacy-bar/) for validated resources. All IR vendors should be routed through legal to maintain attorney-client privilege.

### 5. **Assess Regulated Data Involved**
Use DLP tools like [Varonis](https://www.varonis.com/) or [Microsoft Purview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/information-protection/purview-data-loss-prevention) to trace affected files and confirm sensitivity classification. Query access logs to determine which data subjects were impacted and whether encryption or redaction was applied at rest or in transit.

### 6. **Notify Cyber Insurance Carrier**
Check the cyber policy for explicit timelines—most policies require notification within 24–48 hours of incident discovery. Use your carrier's breach portal (e.g., Chubb, AIG) or breach service like [Beazley Breach Response](https://www.beazley.com/) to initiate case handling. Submit a brief factual summary and defer liability acknowledgments to counsel.

## **Hour 12–24: Forensics and Stakeholder Communication**

### 7. **Launch Full-Scale Digital Forensics Investigation**
Deploy your DFIR team or a third-party vendor. Use endpoint telemetry from tools like [Velociraptor](https://www.velociraptor.app/) or [GRR Rapid Response](https://github.com/google/grr) to monitor active systems. Pull logs from proxy servers, DNS, VPNs, and firewalls. Validate C2 channels, malware signatures, and unauthorized privilege escalation. Conduct static and dynamic malware analysis using [Intezer](https://www.intezer.com/) or [Any.Run](https://any.run/).

### 8. **Control Internal Communication**
Issue a gag order on breach discussions outside secure channels. Create private channels in [Slack Enterprise Grid](https://slack.com/enterprise) or [Mattermost](https://mattermost.com/). Disable auto-archiving if using ephemeral communications and encrypt all messages that reference impacted assets or remediation efforts.

### 9. **Brief Executives and Prepare for Board Updates**
Draft a briefing document with breach scope, legal exposure, IR posture, and stakeholder impact. Use secure board collaboration tools like [BoardEffect](https://www.boardeffect.com/). Reference templates from [SANS](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/ics-cybersecurity-incident-response/) for board-level cybersecurity incident disclosures.

### 10. **Review Contractual Notification Obligations**
Centralize all data processing agreements (DPAs), master service agreements (MSAs), and vendor SLAs using [Ironclad](https://ironcladapp.com/) or [LinkSquares](https://www.linksquares.com/). Flag contracts requiring breach notification within 24–48 hours. Legal must prepare draft notices specific to each partner’s format and regulatory scope.

---

## **Hour 24–48: Regulatory and Contractual Notifications**

### 11. **Draft and Prepare Regulatory Notifications**
Ensure notifications meet jurisdictional criteria. Use [OneTrust](https://www.onetrust.com/products/breach-notification/) to generate GDPR, CCPA, or HIPAA-compliant templates. Validate with external counsel before filing. Cross-check with the [DLA Piper Breach Guide](https://www.dlapiper.com/en/us/insights/topics/data-breach-handbook/).

### 12. **Craft Holding Statements for External Audiences**
Statements should be brief, factual, and non-speculative. Use [Onclusive](https://onclusive.com/) or [Meltwater](https://www.meltwater.com/) to monitor sentiment. Leverage guidance from [CrisisReady](https://crisisreadyinstitute.com/) to align internal and external narratives.

### 13. **Begin Writing Customer and Individual Notifications**
Confirm messaging language, delivery format, and timing with legal. Platforms like [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) and [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) ensure secure, timestamped delivery. Offer impacted users identity theft protection via [IDX](https://www.idx.us/) or [Kroll](https://www.kroll.com/en/services/cyber-risk/incident-response-and-litigation-support). Archive all notifications and recipient logs.

## **Hour 48–72: Finalize Notifications and Monitor Response**

### 14. **Submit Final Regulatory Filings**
Use national portals such as the [ICO Breach Notification Portal](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/report-a-breach/) or [GDPR Register](https://www.gdprregister.eu/). Retain submission receipts, time logs, and acknowledgment confirmations. Legal must cross-check filings against jurisdictional breach reporting timelines.

### 15. **Distribute Notifications to Affected Individuals and Partners**
Use encrypted delivery with delivery verification (e.g., [RPost](https://www.rpost.com/), [DocuSend](https://www.docusend.biz/)). Ensure logs include timestamps, bouncebacks, and opt-out metrics. Consider localized delivery requirements for multilingual populations or data residency constraints.

### 16. **Coordinate Public Messaging via PR Team**
Ensure communications align with the legal position and incident facts. Monitor trends using [Brandwatch](https://www.brandwatch.com/) or [Cision](https://www.cision.com/). Respond to media requests only through designated spokespeople approved by legal.

### 17. **Assess Ongoing Legal Exposure**
Initiate litigation holds with [Zapproved](https://www.zapproved.com/) or [Relativity Legal Hold](https://www.relativity.com/ediscovery-solutions/legal-hold/). Use [Lex Machina](https://lexmachina.com/) or [Westlaw Edge](https://legal.thomsonreuters.com/en/products/westlaw-edge) to monitor case law trends and ongoing litigation risks. Prepare regulatory response binders with incident summaries, forensic reports, and communications logs.
